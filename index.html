            <h3>Hippotherapy Patient Tracking Survey Webapp</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    A web application designed to track and manage patient data for hippotherapy sessions. The app allows
                    therapists to input patient information, session details, and progress reports. It also includes a
                    dashboard for visualizing patient progress over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project challenged me to create a user-friendly mobile app with offline capabilities using Flutter and Firebase. I learned how to handle intermittent connectivity by syncing local storage with cloud data once reconnected. Visualizing patient progress with Syncfusion taught me how to convert raw data into insights for health professionals. This experience strengthened my skills in cross-platform development and real-world data handling.

                <p>
                    Designed and built a photo-collecting website with a custom API, Google OAuth authentication, and a permission-based CRUD interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I explored full-stack development by building a Node.js API, integrating Google OAuth for authentication, and enforcing role-based permissions. It was my first time designing a complete CRUD system with access control. This improved my understanding of backend security and user experience design. I now feel confident building scalable, secure web applications.
